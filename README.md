This ride sharing analysis was done with data used from both Lyft and Uber the data is from 2018 and has rides with city active driver and historic rides with city and driver count with individual fares and city type


# I was Tasked  with  build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
Average Fare ($) Per City

Total Number of Rides Per City

Total Number of Drivers Per City

City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

![Bubble plot](image/bubble.png)

# In addition, I was able to three pie charts:

% of Total Fares by City Type

# my analazyas of the dataing. 
I confirmed my hypothesis in more Urban cities have more rides , drivers with total fair being higher than the other two citie types. What Surprised me was Rural average fair was higher than the other two city types.
