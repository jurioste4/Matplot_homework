            This ride sharing analysis was done with data used from both Lyft and Uber the data is from 2018 
            and has rides with city active driver and historic rides with city and driver count with individual fares and city type.

         <p class="iframe" align="right" style = "font-family:georgia,garamond,serif;font-size:30px;">This bubble plot with average fare for the y axis and Total rides for x axis 
             separated by city type with bubble size being total drivers.
                What I found interesting is Rural cities have a higher average fare but lower total drivers and total rides. 
                And Urban cities have a higher total rides more drivers but the average fare is lower .
